# Motion Detection in Video

This project explores a method for detecting motion in video using Python.

Please see the Jupyter notebook in this repo for a step-by-step walkthrough of the code and process, with detailed notes explaining my reasoning. In future versions of this project, Iâ€™d love to be able to develop a faster editing script for real-time monitoring of a video stream. For now though, 0.50 sec / frame will have to suffice.

The paper [Motion Detection Based on Frame Difference Method](reference_papers/) by Nishu Singla served as my basis for this project, including the ideas of converting to greyscale and binarizing the image.
